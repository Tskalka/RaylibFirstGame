This is a very simple 2d platformer game called "Teleporty Square". It's not a bug, its a feature, instead of traditional
platformers with a jump mechanic this has a teleporting feature. The player can also grab on to the bottom of platforms.
Your main goal is to reach the end platform. Be careful not to fall for that will ensure your demise.

This was a practice project
