#First Game - Teleporty Square
The attempt was to make a platformer using the Raylib C# library. There were a lot of things I learned while doing this project.

Your objective is to make it to the end. Your jump has been replaced by a teleport(it's not a bug it's a feature)
Can you make it to the end without falling off?
