#First Game - Teleporty Square
The attempt was to make a platformer using the Raylib C# library, and using classes in C#. There were a lot of things I learned while doing this project.
The jump just causes the player to teleport up and fall down.

I did not fully understand polymorphism while completing this project. Which is evident by the unorganized code.

Your objective is to make it to the end. Your jump has been replaced by a teleport(it's not a bug it's a feature)
Can you make it to the end without falling off?
